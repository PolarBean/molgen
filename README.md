# Generating molecules by EDMs


EDM can determine xyz coordinates. 

EDMs follow rules based on bonding patterns and torsional stress. 

Can you learn EDM construction rules with a GAN or a GMM? 


Fitted models are compared with a first principles molecule generator that randomly adds bonds based on knowledge of basic bonding rules.
